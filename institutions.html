        <h3>Increased Return for Clients</h3>
        <p>We like winning. It’s why we utilize a proprietary, sector agnostic algorithm developed by PWA’s research department to constantly monitor the market, identify growth sectors, and pinpoint specific sweet spots of the market.</p>
        <h3>Offense/Defense</h3>
        <p>We don’t adhere to a “buy and hold” strategy. We focus on market sectors, for as long as they produce. We don’t care what sector provides growth (equities, fixed income, commodities, etc.) and we hold no preconceived notions about a client’s mix of stocks, bonds, or cash at any given time. Growth is our focus. When a sector falters, we protect capital by moving it to another high performing area of the market or to cash if nothing else is working. Our portfolios average between 5-12 trading days per year.</p>
        <h3>Liberty</h3>
        <p>Preston Wealth Advisors, LLC algorithm offers predictive investment intelligence while our model provides absolute discretion to buy and sell in any sector at any time. In the event neither fixed income nor equity investments offer enough return to justify risk, we can move 100% to cash.</p>
        <h3>Low Fees</h3>
        <p>In the world of Third Party Money Managers, our rates are very competitive. Contact us to learn about our rate structure and what trading platforms we currently use.<p>
        <h3>Trade Notification</h3>
        <p>We notify you of any trades so a client never catches you unaware. We also provide weekly updates on our gross performance.</p>
        <h3>Division of Labor</h3>
        <p>You want to focus on client service, developing relationships, and increasing your assets under management while someone else tends to the portfolios. Preston Wealth Advisors is the “someone else.” Partner with us, and achieve your goals. Contact us today.</p>

            <p class="footer-p disclaimer">
              Actual composite performance results represent all client accounts within each applicable portfolio managed by Preston Wealth Advisors during the corresponding time period. The composite performance results reflect time-weighted rates of return, the reinvestment of dividends and other account earnings, and are net of applicable account transaction and custodial charges, Preston Wealth Advisors’ investment management fees, third-party solicitor/advisor fees, and the fees assessed directly by each unaffiliated mutual fund holding that comprised the Portfolio. The reinvestment of dividends and other earnings may have a material impact on overall returns. For reasons including variances in Portfolio account holdings, variances in the investment management fee incurred, market fluctuation, the date on which a client engaged Preston Wealth Advisors’ investment management services, and any account contributions or withdrawals, the performance of a specific client's account may vary substantially from the indicated Preston Wealth Advisors’ composite performance results. A portion of each account may be actively managed in an attempt to respond to changing conditions.

            <p id="show-this-on-click" class="hide footer-p disclaimer hide">
              Past performance may not be indicative of future results and the performance of a specific individual client account may vary substantially from the composite performance results. Therefore, no current or prospective client should assume that future performance will be profitable, or equal either the Preston Wealth Advisors’ composite performance results reflected above, or the performance results for any of the comparative index benchmarks provided.<br><br>

              Preston Wealth Advisors’ managed accounts may own assets and follow investment strategies which cause them to differ materially from the composition and performance of the indices or benchmarks shown on performance or other reports. Because the strategies used in the accounts or portfolios involve active management of a potentially wide range of assets, no widely recognized benchmark is likely to be representative of the performance of any managed account. Widely known indices and/or market indices are shown simply as a reference to familiar investment benchmarks, not because they are, or are likely to become, representative of past or expected managed account performance.<br><br>

              The historical performance results of the comparative indexes do not include dividends. The results do not reflect the deduction of transaction and custodial charges, nor the deduction of an investment management fee, the incurrence of which would have the effect of decreasing indicated historical performance results. The historical index performance results are provided exclusively for comparison purposes only, so as to provide general comparative information to assist an individual client or prospective client in determining whether a specific Portfolio meets, or continues to meet, his/her investment objective(s). It should not be assumed that account holdings will correspond directly to any of the comparative indexes.<br><br>

              The S&amp;P 500 Index is an unmanaged index and includes a representative sample of large-cap U.S. companies in leading industries. The NASDAQ Composite Index is an unmanaged market-value weighted index of all common stocks listed on NASDAQ. The Dow Jones Corporate Bond Index is an unmanaged index of 96 bonds issued by leading U.S. companies designed to represent the market performance, on a total-return basis, of investment-grade bonds. Unmanaged indices may not be invested in directly.<br><br>

              Different types of investments and/or investment strategies involve varying levels of risk, and there can be no assurance that any specific investment or investment strategy (including the investments purchased and/or investment strategies devised by Preston Wealth Advisors’ will be either suitable or profitable for a client's or prospective client's portfolio and may result in a loss of principal. Accordingly, no client or prospective client should assume that the above portfolios (or any component thereof) serve as the receipt of, or a substitute for, personalized advice from Preston Wealth Advisors, or from any other investment professional.<br><br>

              All performance results have been compiled solely by Preston Wealth Advisors, are unaudited, and have not been independently verified. Information pertaining to Preston Wealth Advisors’ advisory operations, services, and fees is set forth in Preston Wealth Advisors’ current disclosure statement, as same is on file with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, a copy of which is available from Preston Wealth Advisors upon request.
