          <h1>Financial Planning</h1>
          <p>Preston Wealth Advisors reviews a client’s full financial picture.  Then we advise clients how to most likely ensure they meet their short term, intermediate and long term financial goals.</p>
          <div class="align-center"><img src="images/finance.png"></div>
          <p>Preston Wealth Advisor’s financial planning process starts with you. We discuss your present financial status relative to where you’d like to be. Then we construct a strategy to reach—or even exceed—your goals.</p>
          <p>Compiling a comprehensive financial profile doesn’t make Preston Wealth Advisors unique. Our strategies and implementation do.</p>
          <p>To improve overall performance and minimize the impact of debt and taxes, we manage a team of advisors—mortgage brokers, estate planners, CPAs—to ensure all facets of your financial life work toward achieving your goal.  In addition to providing net worth calculations, we go a vital step further, providing Protection and Cash Flow analyses. These allow us to “stress test” our recommendations and strategies.</p>
          <p>Preston Wealth Advisor clients have a secure personal financial home page where they can review daily updates of all accounts in one place, anywhere and any time they have Internet access. Unlike online banking, shopping, or bill pay, our system is non-transactional, providing an added layer of protection.</p>
          <p>Our clients also receive a personal online vault large enough and secure enough to store sensitive personal documents such as wills, trusts, insurance policies, and passports in electronic format. Clients learn the true value of our vaults in times of crisis or natural disaster when hard copies are no longer available.</p>
          <p>Preston Wealth Advisors provides tools and services to ensure your financial world is organized, easy to understand, secure, and always available to you.</p>
          <p>Achieve your financial goals. Contact us today.</p>

          <h1>Professional Athlete Services</h1>
          <p>Our team offers investment and financial management services to professional athletes,  managing their current financial life and helping to secure their financial future, post-sports career.</p>
          <div class="align-center"><img src="images/baseball.png"></div>
          <p>You understand discipline, or you wouldn’t be a professional athlete. The same discipline that got you into the big time can turn your lucrative present into a comfortable future. But you must act now. Since you’re unlikely to earn at the same rate when you retire, your current earnings need to last. The only way to ensure they will is to have a comprehensive game plan and the discipline to execute it. Consider that the average NFL career lasts 31⁄2 years. Just 2 years after their football careers end, 78% of NFL players are bankrupt, or nearly there.</p>
          <p>While career and bankruptcy statistics vary widely from sport to sport, the resounding drumbeat remains: get your financial house in order while you’re earning. Professional Athlete Services is one of our primary practices, led by managing partner and former college athlete, TJ Doremus. Our client roster includes professional athletes from the NHL and MLB. We’re knowledgeable about your unique job demands and have developed tailored concierge financial services to meet your specific needs.</p>
          <p>First, we teach you how your finances work, so you’ll understand the decisions we make on your behalf. Then, in addition to helping you plan, save, and invest for the future, Preston Wealth Advisors helps you manage your life now. We automate your bills, provide counsel and documentation when buying a house, and even oversee everyday services such as housekeeping and pool service.</p>
          <p>Then we turn our attention to your post-sports career, helping you explore ways to capitalize on current skills and experience to launch into the next chapter of your life. Any player can live like a king for a few years. With our help, you can live like a prince for the rest of your life. Getting caught up in the spending frenzy of a professional league lifestyle is easy. Preston Wealth Advisors allows you to enjoy your earnings responsibly while protecting your net worth long term.</p>
          <p>Learn how we can help you work toward securing your financial future.</p>
